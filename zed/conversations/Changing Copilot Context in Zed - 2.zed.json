Highlight Specific Code\n\nWhen you want Copilot to focus on particular code:\n- Select (highlight) the code you want Copilot to use as context\n- Press `Ctrl+Enter` (or the configured Copilot shortcut)\n- Copilot will generate suggestions based on the highlighted selection\n\n## 2. Add Comments for Context\n\nAdd descriptive comments above your code to guide Copilot:\n```python\n# This function should parse JSON data from an API response\ndef parse_data():\n    # Copilot will suggest code based on this comment\n```\n\n## 3. Use Command Palette\n\nTo access Copilot options:\n1. Open Command Palette with `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)\n2. Type \"Copilot\" to see available Copilot commands\n3. Select options like \"Copilot: Show Completions\" or \"Copilot: Explain This\"\n\n## 4. Disable Copilot Temporarily\n\nIf Copilot is using irrelevant context:\n1. Open Command Palette\n2. Select \"Copilot: Toggle Completions\" to disable/enable\n\n## 5. Adjust Project Context Files\n\nFor better project-wide context:\n- Ensure important reference files are open in other tabs\n- Copilot will consider open files as additional context\n\nNote: If you're experiencing issues with Copilot context in Zed, try refreshing the extension or restarting Zed as Copilot integration is still being refined in this editor.\nhow to add working directory as context to github copilot in zed editor?\n\n# Adding Working Directory as Context to GitHub Copilot in Zed Editor\n\nCurrently, Zed's GitHub Copilot integration has somewhat limited built-in functionality for controlling the entire working directory context compared to some other editors. Here are the available approaches:\n\n## Current Best Methods\n\n### 1. Open Relevant Files in Tabs\n\nThe most effective current approach:\n- Open important files from your working directory as tabs in Zed\n- Copilot will include these open files in its context when generating suggestions\n- Focus on opening files that contain relevant APIs, types, or patterns you want Copilot to understand\n\n### 2. Create a Context Comment\n\nAt the top of your working file, create a descriptive comment:\n```\n/*\n * Context: This file is part of the authentication module that uses:\n * - src/models/user.ts for user data structure \n * - src/services/auth.ts for authentication logic\n * - src/utils/validation.ts for input validation\n */\n```\n\n### 3. Reference File Paths in Comments\n\nGuide Copilot with explicit file references:\n```\n// This function should follow the pattern in src/utils/api-handlers.ts\n// and use the types defined in src/types/responses.ts\n```\n\n## Limitations and Future Improvements\n\nUnlike VS Code's more mature Copilot integration, Zed currently doesn't offer:\n- A dedicated command to add workspace/directory as context\n- Advanced context selection options\n\nThe Zed team is actively developing the editor and its AI integrations, so more comprehensive context control features may be added in future updates.\n\n## Workaround for Larger Projects\n\nFor complex projects where context is critical:\n1. Create a \"context.md\" file in your workspace\n2. Document key file structures, relationships, and patterns\n3. Keep this file open in a tab while working\n4. Reference it in your comments to give Copilot better overall project understanding\n\nThis helps bridge the gap until more advanced context management features are implemented in Zed.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":177}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":101},"start":70,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":178}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":102},"start":1545,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":179}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":164},"start":1619,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":180}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":165},"start":3596,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":181}}}],"summary":"Changing Copilot Context in Zed","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
